      <h1 style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0);">HTML</h1>
      <p style="width: 80%;">
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is 
        the foundational language used to 
        create and structure content on the 
        web. It employs a system of tags and 
        attributes to define elements such as
         headings, paragraphs, links, images, 
         and more, enabling browsers to display 
         text, multimedia, and interactive forms 
         in a structured and visually appealing 
         manner. HTML is essential for building 
         web pages, providing the basic framework
         upon which CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
         and JavaScript enhance and control presentation
          and interactivity. As a constantly evolving
           standard, HTML continues to adapt to the 
           growing needs of web developers and users,
            supporting new features and technologies 
            to improve the web experience.

      <div class="CSS">
        <h1 style="color: rgb(8, 23, 233);">CSS</h1>
        <p style="width: 80%;">
         CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet 
         language used to control the presentation and
          layout of web pages. It allows developers to
           separate content from design, providing the
            means to specify how HTML elements should 
            be displayed in terms of color, font, spacing,
             alignment, and other visual aspects. By using 
             CSS, you can create consistent and attractive
              web designs across multiple pages, making it 
              easier to maintain and update the site's 
              appearance. CSS can be applied inline, 
              embedded within HTML, or stored in external
               style sheets for better modularity and 
               reusability. Additionally, CSS supports 
               responsive design principles, enabling web
                pages to adapt seamlessly to different 
                screen sizes and devices, enhancing the
                 user experience.

    <div class="js">
      <h1 style="color: #ffd000;">JavaScript</h1>
      <p style="width: 80%;">
        JavaScript is a versatile, high-level 
        programming language that is essential for
         creating dynamic and interactive web 
         applications. Unlike HTML and CSS, which
          handle the structure and style of web pages,
           JavaScript enables developers to implement 
           complex features such as form validation,
            animations, and real-time updates without 
            reloading the page. It is widely used for
             both client-side and server-side development,
              making it a cornerstone of modern web 
              technologies. JavaScript can manipulate
               the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing
                for the interactive and responsive behavior 
                of web elements. Additionally, with the 
                advent of frameworks and libraries like 
                React, Angular, and Node.js, JavaScript 
                has expanded its capabilities, facilitating
                 efficient and scalable application 
                 development across various platforms.
